# CPQ CLOUD TO SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT CLOUD INTEGRATION TEST

![Homepage](Images/image1.png)


## BACKGROUND

This document outlines a step-by-step guide on how to import Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) artifacts from Oracle Cloud Marketplace into an OIC environment, and create web service connections between CPQ Cloud and Subscription Mangement Cloud. This lab will focus on how to create subscriptions and terminate subscriptions in CPQ, and have those changes reflected in Subscripton Managment Cloud.

The business scenario is to allow sales teams to capture subscription orders and perform subscription management activities throughout the lifecycle of these customer relationships. The integration, enabled by Oracleâ€™s next generation Oracle Integration Cloud middleware, comes with a Subscription Management package that includes installable artifacts for both CPQ Cloud and OIC.

## COMPONENTS COVERED

* How to download integration artifacts from Oracle Cloud Marketplace
* How to import integration artifacts into OIC
* How to update web service connections
* How to activate integrations
* How to create subscriptions through CPQ Cloud
* How to terminate subscriptions through CPQ Cloud
